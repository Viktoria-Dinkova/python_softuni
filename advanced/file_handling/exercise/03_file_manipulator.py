"""
Create a program that will receive commands until the command "End". The commands can be:
路 "Create-{file_name}" - Creates the given file with empty content. If the file already exists, remove the existing text in it (as if the file is created again)
路 "Add-{file_name}-{content}" - Append the content and a new line after it. If the file does not exist, create it, and add the content
路 "Replace-{file_name}-{old_string}-{new_string}" - Open the file and replace all the occurrences of the old string with the new string. If the file does not exist, print: "An error occurred"
路 "Delete-{file_name}" - Delete the file. If the file does not exist, print: "An error occurred"
