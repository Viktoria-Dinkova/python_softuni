'''
Write a function called operate that receives an operator ("+", "-", "*" or "/") as Ð° first argument and multiple numbers (integers) as additional arguments (*args).
The function should return the result of the operator applied to all the numbers. For more clarification, see the examples below.
Submit only your function in the Judge system.
Note: Be careful when you have multiplication and division

from functools import reduce
def operate(operator: str, *args: int) -> int:

    if operator == '+':
        return reduce(lambda x,y: x+y, args)

    elif operator == '-':
        return reduce(lambda x, y: x-y, args)

    elif operator == '*':
        return reduce(lambda x, y: x*y, args)

    elif operator == '/':
        return reduce(lambda x, y: x/y, args)

# print(operate("*", 3, 4))
