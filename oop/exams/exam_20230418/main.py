o	Set is_damaged initial value to false.
Methods
__init__(brand: str, model: str, license_plate_number: str, max_mileage: float)
•	In the __init__ method, all the needed attributes must be set.
drive(mileage: float)
•	The method reduces the battery level by a certain percentage. Each type of vehicle implements this method differently.
recharge()
•	This method restores the value of the battery level to 100%.
change_status()
•	This method sets the value of is_damaged.
o	If the value is false, set it to true
o	otherwise, set it to false.

Methods
__init__(brand: str, model: str, license_plate_number: str)
•	In the __init__ method, all the needed attributes must be set.
drive(mileage: float)
•	The method reduces the battery level by a certain percentage. First, compute what part of the max_mileage will be passed (for example: if the given mileage is 90 kilometers and the vehicle’s max mileage is 180 kilometers, then you should reduce the battery level by 50%), then reduce the battery level with the calculated value. The percentage should be rounded to the closest integer number.

Methods
__init__(brand: str, model: str, license_plate_number: str )
•	In the __init__ method, all the needed attributes must be set.
drive(mileage: float)
•	The method reduces the battery level by a certain percentage. First, compute what part of the max_mileage will be passed (for example: if the given mileage is 90 kilometers and the vehicle’s max mileage is 180 kilometers, then you should reduce the battery level by 50%), then reduce the battery level with the calculated value. Also, when driving CargoVan, you should reduce an additional 5%, because of the load.  The percentage should be rounded to the closest integer number.

•	is_locked: bool
o	The value represents the status of the route.
o	Set is_locked initial value to false.
Methods

Methods
__init__()
•	In the __init__ method, all the needed attributes must be set.
register_user(first_name: str, last_name: str, driving_license_number: str)
The method should create and add a new user to the users’ collection.
•	If there is already a user with the same driving license number, return the following message:
"{driving_license_number} has already been registered to our platform."

•	First, check If the given vehicle type  is NOT a valid type (PassengerCar or CargoVan), and return the following message:
"Vehicle type {vehicle_type} is inaccessible."
•	Then, check If there is already a vehicle with the same license plate number, and return the following message:
"{license_plate_number} belongs to another vehicle."

"{start_point}/{end_point} - {length} km had already been added to our platform."
•	If there is already a route with the given start point, end point and its length is less than the given length, return the following message:
"{start_point}/{end_point} shorter route had already been added to our platform."
•	If none of the above cases was reached, create a new route and add it to the routes list.
o	Return the following message:
"{start_point}/{end_point} - {length} km is unlocked and available to use."
o	If there is already a route with the given start point, end point, and greater length, lock the longer route.
make_trip(driving_license_number: str, license_plate_number: str, route_id: int,  is_accident_happened: bool)
•	There will always be a user with the corresponding driving license number, already added to the users’ list.
•	There will always be a vehicle with the corresponding license plate number, already added to the vehicles list.
•	There will always be a route with the corresponding route id, already added to the routes list.
•	The vehicle will always have enough battery to finish the trip.
A user with the given driving license number will take a trip on the route with specified route id and vehicle with stated license plate number:
•	First, check If the user with the given driving license number is blocked (is_blocked = True) in the application, cancel the trip and return the following message:
"User {driving_license_number} is blocked in the platform! This trip is not allowed."
•	Then, check If the vehicle with the given license plate number is damaged (is_damaged = True) in the application, cancel the trip and return the following message:
"Vehicle {license_plate_number} is damaged! This trip is not allowed."
•	Afterwards, check If the route with the given route id is locked (is_locked = True) in the application, cancel the trip and return the following message:
"Route {route_id} is locked! This trip is not allowed."
•	Drive the specific vehicle on the specific route. The trip should take effect on the battery level of the vehicle.
•	If the value of the parameter is_accident_happened is true, the is_damaged status of the vehicle should be changed to true. The rating of the user who has rented the vehicle should be decreased.
•	Otherwise, increase the user’s rating.
•	 Return actual information about the vehicle, after making the trip, in the following format:
"{brand} {model} License plate: {license_plate_number} Battery: {battery_level}% Status: OK/Damaged"
"OK" or "Damaged" string depends on the damaged status of the vehicle.
repair_vehicles(count: int)
The method should select only those vehicles from the vehicles’ collection, which are damaged. Order the selected vehicles alphabetically by their brand, then alphabetically by their model. Take the first {count} vehicles, if there are more damaged vehicles, otherwise take all of the damaged vehicles. The count will be a positive integer or zero.
•	Each of the chosen vehicles will be repaired (is_damaged = False) and recharged (battery level restored to 100%).
•	Return the following message:
"{count_of_repaired_vehicles} vehicles were successfully repaired!"
users_report()
Returns information about each user from the users’ collection. Arrange the users by rating, descending. To get the correct output, use the __str__() method of each user. The output for each user should be on a new line:
"*** E-Drive-Rent ***
{user1}
{user2}
