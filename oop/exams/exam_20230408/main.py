Methods
__init__(name: str, kind: str, price: float, weight: int)
•	In the __init__ method, all the needed attributes must be set.
eating()
•	The method increases the robot's kilograms. Keep in mind that each kind of robot implements the method differently.

eating()
•	The method increases the robot's weight by 3 kilograms.
4.	Class BaseService
In the base_service.py file, the class BaseService should be implemented. It is a base class for any type of service, and it should not be able to be instantiated.
Structure
The class should have the following attributes:
•	name: str
o	The value represents the name of the service.
o	If the name is an empty string or contains only white spaces, raise a ValueError with the message: "Service name cannot be empty!"
•	capacity: int
o	The value represents the number of robots а service can have.
o	If the capacity is less than or equal to 0, raise a ValueError with the message: "Service capacity cannot be less than or equal to 0!"
•	robots: list
o	Empty list that will contain robots (objects) added to the service.
Methods
__init__(name: str, capacity: int)
•	In the __init__ method, all the needed attributes must be set.
details()
•	Returns a string with information about the service depending on its type.
5.	Class MainService
In the main_service.py file, the class MainService should be implemented. Main service is a type of BaseService. Each main service has a capacity of 30.
Methods
__init__(name: str)
•	In the __init__ method, all the needed attributes must be set.
details()
•	Returns a string in the following format:
"{service_name} Main Service:
Robots: {robot_name1} {robot_name2} … {robot_nameN}"
•	If the service doesn't have any robots, add "none" instead of the robots' names:
"{service_name} Main Service:
Robots: none"
6.	Class SecondaryService
In the secondary_service.py file, the class SecondaryService should be implemented. Secondary service is a type of BaseService. Each secondary service has a capacity of 15.
Methods
__init__(name: str)
•	In the __init__ method, all the needed attributes must be set.
details()
•	Returns a string in the following format:
"{service_name} Secondary Service:
Robots: {robot_name1} {robot_name2} … {robot_nameN}"
•	If the service doesn't have any robots, add "none" instead of the robots' names:
"{service_name} Secondary Service:
Robots: none"
7.	Class RobotsManagingApp
In the robots_managing_app.py file, the class RobotsManagingApp should be implemented. It will contain the functionality of the project.
Structure
The class should have the following attributes:
•	robots: list
o	Empty list that will contain all robots (objects) that are created.
•	services: list
o	Empty list that will contain all services (objects) that are created.
Methods
__init__()
•	In the __init__ method, all the needed attributes must be set.
add_service(service_type: str, name: str)
The method creates a service of the given type and adds it to the services collection.
All service names will be unique.
•	If the service type is not valid, raise an Exception with the following message:
"Invalid service type!"
•	Otherwise, create the service, add it to the services list, and return the following message:
"{service_type} is successfully added."
•	Valid types of services are: "MainService" and "SecondaryService"
add_robot(robot_type: str, name: str, kind: str, price: float)
The method creates a robot of the given type and adds it to the robots' collection.
All robots' names will be unique.
•	If the robot type is not valid, raise an Exception with the following message:
"Invalid robot type!"
•	Otherwise, create the robot, add it to the robots' list, and return the following message:
"{robot_type} is successfully added."
•	Valid types of robots are: "MaleRobot" and "FemaleRobot"
add_robot_to_service(robot_name: str, service_name: str)
The method adds the robot with the given name to the service if there is a capacity for that. Both robot and service with the given names will always exist.
•	First, check if the robot can be added to the service. The Female robot can be ONLY added to the Secondary Service and the Male robot can be ONLY added to the Main Service. In case of a mismatch, return the message: "Unsuitable service."
•	Next, if there is NOT enough capacity to add the robot to the service, raise an Exception with the following message: "Not enough capacity for this robot!"
•	If the robot can be added successfully to the service, remove it from the robots' collection, and add it to the service. Return the following message: "Successfully added {robot_name} to {service_name}."
remove_robot_from_service(robot_name: str, service_name: str)
The method removes the robot with the given name from the service. The service with the given name will always exist.
•	Check if there is a robot with the given name in the service. If not, raise an Exception with the following message: "No such robot in this service!"
•	If the robot can be removed successfully from the service, remove it from the service, and add it back to the robots' collection. Return the following message: "Successfully removed {robot_name} from {service_name}."
feed_all_robots_from_service(service_name: str)
The method feeds all robots from the service. The service with the given name will always exist. When all robots from the service are successfully fed (hint: use eating() method), return the following message:
"Robots fed: {number_of_robots_fed}."
service_price(service_name: str)
The method calculates the price of all robots that are in the service. The service with the given name will always exist.
Return the calculated price, formatted to the second decimal place with the following message:
"The value of service {service_name} is {total_price}."
__str__()
Returns information about each service (hint: you can use the service details() method)
"{service_name1} {service_type}:
Robots: {robot_name1} {robot_name2} … {robot_nameN}
{service_name2} {service_type}:
Robots: {robot_name1} {robot_name2} … {robot_nameN}
