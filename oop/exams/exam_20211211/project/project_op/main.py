1.	Class Car
In the file car.py, the class Car should be implemented. It is a base class for any type of car, and it should not be able to be instantiated.
Structure
The class should have the following attributes:
•	model: str
o	If the model is less than 4 symbols, raise a ValueError with the message "Model {model} is less than 4 symbols!"
•	speed_limit: int
o	Every type of car has a different range of speed limit. If it is not in the valid range, raise a ValueError with the message "Invalid speed limit! Must be between {min_speed_limit} and {max_speed_limit}!"
o	All speed limit values will be unique. You do NOT need to check it explicitly.
•	is_taken: bool
o	The default value is False.
o	One car can be driven by ONLY one driver.
Methods
__init__(model: str, speed_limit: int)
In the __init__ method all the needed attributes must be set.
2.	Class MuscleCar
In the muscle_car.py file, the class MuscleCar should be implemented. It is a type of car. Each muscle car's minimum speed limit is 250, and its maximum speed limit is 450 (inclusive).
3.	Class SportsCar
In the sports_car.py file, the class SportsCar should be implemented. It is a type of car. Each sports car's minimum speed limit is 400, and its maximum speed limit is 600 (inclusive).
4.	Class Driver
In the driver.py file, the class Driver should be implemented. It will store the info of each driver.
Structure
The class should have the following attributes:
•	name: str
o	If the name is an empty string or contains only white spaces (one or many), raise a ValueError with the message "Name should contain at least one character!"
•	car: Car
o	The default value is None.
o	One driver drives ONLY one car.
•	number_of_wins: int
o	The default value is 0.
o	When the driver wins a race, the number of wins should be increased!
Methods
__init__(name: str)
In the __init__ method all the needed attributes must be set.
5.	Class Race
In the race.py file, the class Race should be implemented. It will store the info of each race.
Structure
The class should have the following attributes:
•	name: str
o	If the name is an empty string, raise a ValueError with the message "Name cannot be an empty string!"
•	drivers: list
o	An empty list that will contain all the drivers (objects) participating in the race
Methods
__init__(name: str)
In the __init__ method all the needed attributes must be set.
6.	Class Controller
In the controller.py file, the class Controller should be implemented. It will contain all the functionality of the project.
Structure
The class should have the following attributes:
•	cars: list
o	An empty list that will contain all cars (objects)
•	drivers: list
o	An empty list that will contain all drivers (objects)
•	races: list
o	An empty list that will contain all races (objects)
Methods
__init__()
In the __init__ method all the needed attributes must be set.
create_car(car_type: str, model: str, speed_limit: int)
•	Create a car with the provided model and speed limit and add it to the cars' list.
•	If the car is successfully created, the method should return the message "{car_type} {model} is created."
•	If the car of the same model already exists, raise an Exception with the message "Car {model} is already created!"
•	The valid car types are "MuscleCar" and "SportsCar". In any other case, ignore the command.
create_driver(driver_name: str)
•	Creates a driver with the given name and adds it to the drivers' list.
•	If the driver is successfully created, the method should return the message "Driver {name} is created."
•	If a driver with the given name already exists, raise an Exception with the message "Driver {name} is already created!"
create_race(race_name: str)
•	Creates a race with the given name and adds it to the races' list.
•	If the race is successfully created, the method should return the message "Race {name} is created."
•	If the race with the given name already exists, throw an Exception with the message "Race {name} is already created!"
add_car_to_driver(driver_name: str, car_type: str)
•	Set the last car added from the given type to the driver with the given name (if they both exist).
•	If the driver does not exist in the drivers' list, raise an Exception with the message "Driver {name} could not be found!"
•	If there is no available car (all cars from that type are taken or does not exist) from the given type in the cars' list, raise an Exception with the message "Car {car_type} could not be found!". The car types are "MuscleCar" and "SportsCar".
•	First, check if the driver exists!
•	If there is an available car (the car is not taken), but the driver already has a car, change it with the new one, change it to taken and return the message "Driver {name} changed his car from {old_model} to {new_model}."
•	If they both exist, the driver doesn't own a car, and the car is not taken, you should set the car (object) to the driver and return the message "Driver {driver_name} chose the car {car_model}."
add_driver_to_race(race_name: str, driver_name: str)
•	Adds a driver (object) with the given name to the race with the given name (if they both exist).
•	If the race does not exist in the races' list, raise an Exception with the message "Race {name} could not be found!"
•	If the driver does not exist in the drivers' list, raise an Exception with the message "Driver {name} could not be found!"
•	First, check if the race exists!
•	A driver can participate in a race, ONLY if he has a car. If the driver doesn't own a car, raise an Exception with the message "Driver {driver_name} could not participate in the race!"
•	If they both exist and the driver owns a car, you should add the driver (object) to the race and return the message "Driver {driver_name} added in {race_name} race."
•	If the driver has already participated in the race, return the message "Driver {driver_name} is already added in {race_name} race."
start_race(race_name: str)
•	If the race does not exist in the races' list, raise an Exception with the message "Race {name} could not be found!"
•	If the participants in the race are less than 3, raise an Exception with the message "Race {race_name} cannot start with less than 3 participants!"
•	If the race exists and participants in the race are at least 3, the race starts. The fastest 3 cars win the race and increase their number of wins by 1. You should return a message for each of them in descending order in the format:
"Driver {fastest_driver_name} wins the {race_name} race with a speed of {speed_limit}."
