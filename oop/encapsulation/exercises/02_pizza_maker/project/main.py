"""
Create a class called Topping. Upon initialization, it should receive:
•	topping_type: str - if the topping is an empty string, raise a ValueError with the message "The topping type cannot be an empty string"
•	weight: float - if the weight is 0 or less, raise a ValueError with the message "The weight cannot be less or equal to zero"
Hint: Use Getters and Setters.
Create a class called Dough. Upon initialization, it should receive:
•	flour_type: str - if the flour type is an empty string, raise a ValueError with the message "The flour type cannot be an empty string"
•	baking_technique: str - if the technique is an empty string, raise a ValueError with the message "The baking technique cannot be an empty string"
•	weight: float - if the weight is 0 or less, raise a ValueError with the message "The weight cannot be less or equal to zero"
Create a class called Pizza. Upon initialization, it should receive:
•	name: str - if the name is an empty string, raise a ValueError with the message "The name cannot be an empty string"
•	dough: Dough - if the dough is None, raise a ValueError with the message "You should add dough to the pizza"
•	max_number_of_toppings: int – represents the maximum number of toppings the pizza should have. If it is 0 or less, raise a ValueError with the message "The maximum number of toppings cannot be less or equal to zero"
•	toppings: dict – empty dictionary upon initialization containing the topping type as a key and the topping's weight as a value.
The class should also have 2 instance methods:
•	add_topping(topping: Topping)
o	Add a new topping to the dictionary
o	If there is no space left for a new topping, raise a ValueError: "Not enough space for another topping"
o	If the topping is already in the dictionary, increase the value of its weight.
•	calculate_total_weight() - returns the total weight of the pizza (dough's weight and toppings' weight)
