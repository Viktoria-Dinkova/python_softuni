"""
Create a class called Cup. Upon initialization, it should receive size (integer) and quantity (an integer representing how much liquid is in it).
The class should have two methods:
•	fill(quantity) that will increase the amount of liquid in the cup with the given quantity (if there is space in the cup, otherwise ignore).
•	status() that will return the amount of free space left in the cup.
Submit only the class in the judge system. Do not forget to test your code.
