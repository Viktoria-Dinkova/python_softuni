"""
The Player class should receive a username (string), a hp (int), and a mp (int) upon initialization.
The Player also has 2 instance attributes: skills (an empty dictionary that will contain the skills of each player and its mana cost) and a guild set to "Unaffiliated" by default.
The Player class should also have two additional methods:
-	add_skill(skill_name, mana_cost)
o	Adds the skill and the corresponding mana cost to the dictionary of skills. Returns "Skill {skill_name} added to the collection of the player {player_name}"
o	If the skill is already in the collection, return "Skill already added"
-	player_info()
o	Returns the player's information, including their skills, in this format:
"Name: {player_name}
 Guild: {guild_name}
 HP: {hp}
 MP: {mp}
 ==={skill_name_1} - {skill_mana_cost}
 ==={skill_name_2} - {skill_mana_cost}
 â€¦
 ==={skill_name_N} - {skill_mana_cost}"
