# Write a program that calculates the total cost of bought furniture.
# You will be given information about each purchase on separate lines until you receive the command "Purchase".
# Valid information should be in the format: ">>{furniture_name}<<{price}!{quantity}".
# The price could be a floating-point or integer number. You should store the names of the furniture and the total price.
# In the end, print the name of each bought furniture and the total cost, formatted to the second decimal point:
# "Bought furniture:
# {1st name}
# {2nd name}
# â€¦
# {N name}
# Total money spend: {total_cost}"
