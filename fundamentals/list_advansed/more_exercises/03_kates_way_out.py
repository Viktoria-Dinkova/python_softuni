# Kate is stuck in a maze. You should help her to find her way out.
# On the first line, you will be given how many rows there are in the maze.
# On the following n lines, you will be given the maze itself. Here is a legend for the maze:
# •	"#" - means a wall; Kate cannot go through there
# •	" " - means empty space; Kate can go through there
# •	"k" - the initial position of Kate; start looking for a way out from there
# There are two options: Kate either gets out or not:
# •	If Kate can get out, print the following:
# "Kate got out in {number_of_moves} moves".
# Note: If there are two or more ways out, she always chooses the longest one.
# •	Otherwise, print: "Kate cannot get out".
